##### Process of Class Extraction
* DRY code with method extraction
* Once code is as clean as can be
* Create and set up new class
* Understand where we will initialize that object of the class (make sure it is assigned to a variable or instance variable)
* Find the first method to extract and move to new class
* Re-connect the functionality using the variable assigned
* Run tests and fix errors
* Repeat from extraction

#### OOP with Rich
##### Abstraction
* You only need to know the way to interact with it
* Helps with future development
* Easy to modify code without effecting user
* Everything is abstraction - TV, Sofa, Table

##### Inheritance
* Child takes on characteristics or property of the parent
* Makes modification easier on parent that the child will inherit
* Eg. Tetris. Shape as the parent class, types or colours as child classes

* Polymorphism - Dog type and then breed
* ensures the paramater passed is a class

## Pairing with Rich

#### Types of brain activity when learning
* Focused mode - same route as before
* Free thinking mode - cool down and reset

#### Process for creating a plan when blocked
* We have hit a road block and stopped
* Where are we?
* What are we trying to accomplish?
* Why are we doing it this way?
* What are my alternatives?

#### RSpec specific questions
* What output are we trying to match?
* Have we set up the environment correctly?
* Are our mocks and stubs effecting our output?
