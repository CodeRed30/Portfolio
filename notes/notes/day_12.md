# Day 12 Notes

## Group call - Karsten_Katrina_Pete_Tom
#### Why ask for a code review?
* Don't know where to go next with your program
* Check process

## [HTTP Process Workshop](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-3/process_modelling)
##### What is a process model?
* A process model is a diagram/performance/[something else] that demonstrates how a process works.

##### Why do we use it?
* It's a quick way to figure out and cement your understanding of how a process works.
* It's much quicker than writing the code that enacts the process.
* It's much easier to iterate on a process model than the code that enacts the process.
* It's much easier to add detail to a process model than to add it to code.
* It's a great way to communicate and discuss a process with another person.


##### How to access a webpage's process log
1. Right click on webpage
2. Select inspect
3. Select network
* Use timeline to understand order of loading - and select a timeframe
* Name/Status/Type to see specific objects
* Select name to view
* - Headers - to see request/response info
* - Preview/Response - to understand which part of code/image it is correlating too
* - [Timing](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network/reference?utm_source=devtools#timing-explanation) - to view the breakdown of what happened and in what order

##### Notes
* http.cat - for status codes  
* [UML diagramming ](https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/types-of-UML-diagrams)- standardised modelling language used for diagramming in software
