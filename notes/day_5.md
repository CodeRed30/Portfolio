# Day 5 Notes

## Group call - Karsten_Katrina_Pete_Tom
#### Goals for SDL
* Be confident with BB Challenge to go into weekend Challenge
* Understand @bikes = bikes

## SDL Exercise
* Do Boris-Bikes by myself
https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-1/writing_tests


## Retrospective
#### Went well
* Pair programming - driver/navigator set up
* TDD - learnt new syntax
* Debugging - working through Boris Bikes and fixing my own test and code bugs
* OOP - using encapsulation and SRP in my code base

#### Could improve
* Pair programming - asserting my lack of knowledge and need to pause to catch up
* TDD - working in through the process
* Debugging - reading the stack trace properly rather than assuming
* OOP - Mocking and stubbing 

## Pairing - Boris Bikes Day 4 - Pete
