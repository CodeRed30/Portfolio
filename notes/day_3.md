# Day 3 Notes

## Group call - Alice + Karsten_Katrina_Pete_Tom
* Alice - will be our coach for week 2
* Eoin - coach week 3 & 4
* Reflection is a key tool for learning

#### SMART goals
Make daily and weekly goals
* S - Specific
* M - Measurable
* A - Achievable
* R - Relevant
* T - Time bound

#### Today's SDL goals
| | RSpec | OOP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Goal | Greater understanding of RSpec syntax | Greater understanding of OOP |
| Achieve | Research and re-read yesterdays resources | OOP resources |
| Evidence | More comfortable pairing later | Explain basic OOP principles |

## SDL
#### OOP
* [Encapsulation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ruby-encapsulation/) - the grouping of data so it is not widely accessible, unless explicitly called upon. eg. creating  a class and putting methods inside that class
* [Abstraction](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-abstraction-in-ruby/) - Separating data so some can be visibile and others isn't. eg using Public and Private inside of a class
* [Inheritance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ruby-inheritance/) - Data can take on the characteristics of another group - like Parent and Child eg. sub-class taking on the characteristics of a master-class
* [Polymorphism](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/polymorphism-in-ruby/) - the ability to use the same method on different objects eg1. (using inheritance) use different classes but have the same methods in each class eg2. (using Duck-Typing) similar to inheritance but the parent class's output is the method itself
* SRP - Single responsibility principle - every class and method should only be responsible for one thing

## Pairing - Boris Bikes Day 2 - Salar
#### Types of RSpec tests
* State tests - test if something exists - usually a responds_to test
* Behaviour tests - test the behaviour of a method - to eq style test and includes an it explanation

#### Subject in RSpec tests
Used to represent a new instance of a class in the test and is used as its placeholder

#### Unit Test/Feature Test
* Unit test - tests individual logic of specific objects
* Feature test - Tests the whole program like a user would use it and makes sure everything works together
