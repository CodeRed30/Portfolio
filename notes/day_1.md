How to thrive at Makers...
"Our mission is to transform lives -
Accelerating the careers of software development professionals by integrating training with employment"

Happiness is now a pre-requisite in a whole and authentic life

#### Makers
* Sense of control and completion is rare at Makers - Marathon not a sprint
* Build resilience to tackle the rollercoaster of emotions
* Sleep well - work on sleep hygiene
* Personal development and transformation - you wont be the same person at the end of the course
* Time moves very quickly - say YES to everything, use everything and everyone
* Manage your energy - teach people how to treat you - mood check ins help to clear the space, What gets your back to zero?
* Timebox your weekend to be most efficient - working alone can be tough on your mental health
* Don't compare your work ethic, do what is best for you and your wellbeing
* Imposterism/Imposter syndrome is normal - speak it out loud and get it out of your system, your ego will be very challenged at Makers
* You will be triggered - lean in to make yourself better
* Its ok, to be ok! - don't sweat if its going well or bad - get comfortable with being uncomfortable

* Am I a better developer than I was yesterday? Am I having fun (engaged/stimulated)?
* Be more deliberate and intentional
