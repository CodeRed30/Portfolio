# Day 4 Notes

## Group call - Alice + Karsten_Katrina_Pete_Tom
All struggling to understand

## [TDD Workshop](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/week-1/TDD_process.md)
#### Why do we write tests?
* The ensure code is working
* Write code in a logical way
* Feedback loop
* To help you debug
* Follow requirements in user stories
* See how changes effect the codebase
* History of work
* For other devs to understand codebase
* Understand interdependencies
* Error codes and stack trace are helpful to debug
* Focus on the task
* Edge case testing makes program more robust

#### Why do we write tests first?
* TDD cycle - build from the simplest and build out from there
* More intuitive
* Safer when you refactor your code
* Less bugs
* Better test coverage
* More efficient
* Cheaper & cost effective

#### Breakout Session - Holly, Reeshul, Jonathan, Josh & Katrina
User stories -> feature test -> unit test -> red -> write code -> green -> refactor -> Start again

#### Pair exercise with Hamish
* One task per method
* How to test for rand?
