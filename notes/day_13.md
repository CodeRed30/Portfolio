#### [How the internet works pt.1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4S8zfLdLgQ&t=1s)
##### Front-end POV
* Client (browser) making requests to the server and getting responses back
* Request - When connecting to the server you get the IP address
* Response - Your ISP looks up the IP address of a site and directs you to that IP
* Browser knows what its response is by the file suffix
* Processes - Parses - throught the HTML once it finda request for an asset
* Request back to the server and response in that new file type
* CSS has to go to the top of the head to make sure the page loads correctly
* Most cases JS scripts and go at the end of the body tag. Means page will load assets first then fancy functions
* Concatenate all your JS and CSS files into one (post development) for faster loading
* GET - Load a page (homepage)
* POST - Input data (log in or post tweet)
* PUT - for editing content (editing a tweet)
* DELETE - delete content (deleting a tweet)
